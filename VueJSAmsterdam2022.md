# GETTING MORE OUT OF YOUR PINIA STORES
Speaker: Eduardo San Martin Morote - Creator at Vue-Router at Vue.js

- Pinia holds the state of the stores, allowing the users to also access them via Pinia's object. For example:

```js
const authStore = useAuthStore()
// authStore.$state -> pinia.state.value.auth

pinia.state.value.auth.user.login //bob
authStore.$state.user.login //bob
authStore.$state.login //bob
```

- If you want to persist a Pinia store in Client Side Rendering:

```js
import {useLocalStorage} from '@vueuse/core'

const useAuthStore = defineStore('auth', {
    state: () => ({
	    user: {
		    login: useLocalStorage('pinia/user/login', 'alice'),
	    },
    }),
})

```

- New hooks for SSR: 
    - hidratate(): To to hidratate the state. 
    - skipHidrate(): Tells Pinia to skip the hydration process of a given object. This is useful in setup stores (only) when you return a stateful object in the store but it isn't really state. e.g. returning a router instance in a setup store.

# PETITE-VUE - PROGRESSIVELY ENHANCING ANY APPLICATION?
Speaker: Alexander Lichter - Nuxt.js Core Team and Founder of Developmint and a passionate Full-Stack Developer

Introduced [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue), an alternate distribution of Vue with limited functionality, but also highly reduced bundle size. It is inspired in Alpine, a minimalistic frontend framework.

It is specially nice in cases where some basic interactivity needs to be added to a static site, without creating a complete SPA.
